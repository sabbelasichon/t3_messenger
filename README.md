## Integration guide

The extension basically provides the same functionality as if you would use the messenger in the Symfony Framework.
In order to configure the messenger you have to put a Messenger.php file under the Configuration folder of an extension.

```php

return [
    'failure_transport' => 'failed',
    'default_bus' => 'command.bus',
    'transports' => [
        'async' => [
            'dsn' => 'typo3-db://Default',
        ],
        'failed' => [
            'dsn' => 'typo3-db://Default',
            'options' => [
                'queue_name' => 'failed',
            ],
        ],
    ],
    'routing' => [
        MyCommand::class => ['senders' => ['async']],
    ],
    'buses' => [
        'command.bus' => [
            'middleware' => [
                'id' => 'validation',
            ],
        ],
        'query.bus' => [
            'default_middleware' => [
                'enabled' => true,
                'allow_no_handlers' => false,
                'allow_no_senders' => true,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

```

## Extbase Entities in Messages

If you need to pass an Extbase entity in a message, it's better to pass the entity's primary key (or whatever relevant information the handler actually needs, like email, etc.) instead of the object.

Have a look at the Symfony Documentation about [Doctrine Entities](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#doctrine-entities-in-messages)


## Transport Configuration

Messenger supports a number of different transport types, each with their own options. Options can be passed to the transport via a DSN string or configuration.

Have a look at the Symfony Documentation about [Transports](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#transport-configuration)

### Custom Doctrine Transport

The extension ships the [doctrine transport](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#doctrine-transport) with a slightly modified configuration DSN.
Instead of using doctrine:// you have to use typo3-db://.

```php

return [
    'transports' => [
        'async' => [
            'dsn' => 'typo3-db://Default',
        ],
    ],
];

```

The format is typo3-db://<connection_name>, in case you have multiple connections and want to use one other than the "Default".
The transport will automatically create a table named messenger_messages.

Please have a look for further configuration details at the [doctrine transport](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#doctrine-transport).

## Null Transport

The extension ships also with a NullTransport. This is useful if you want some messages in some instances not to be handled at all.

## Middleware

Have a look at the Symfony Documentation about [Middleware](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#middleware) to understand the concept behind it.

The extension ships with a ValidationMiddleware for the extbase Validators.
If you want to validate your commands add the middleware the following way in your Messenger.php:

```php
return [
    'buses' => [
        'messenger.bus.default' => [
            'middleware' => [
                'id' => 'validation',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

**Note**: The id validation is a shortcut for the service id **messenger.middleware.validation**.

Additionally, the extension ships with a LoggingMiddleware for debugging purposes.

```php
return [
    'buses' => [
        'messenger.bus.default' => [
            'middleware' => [
                'id' => 'logging',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Async Mailer
The extension ships with a custom MessengerMailer which implements [MailerInterface](https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Mail/MailerInterface.php) from TYPO3 core in order to send emails asynchronously if it is desired.
Even if you are using TYPO3 10 you can already use the new MailerInterface.
Inject the MailerInterface wherever you want:

```php

use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Mail\MailerInterface;
use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Mail\MailMessage;
use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility;

final class RegistrationService
{
    private MailerInterface $mailer;

    public function __construct(MailerInterface $mailer)
    {
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }

    public function register()
    {
        $mailMessage = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(MailMessage::class);
        $mailMessage->setTo('max.mustermann@domain.com');
        $mailMessage->setSubject('You MailerInterface');
        $this->mailer->send($mailMessage);
    }
}
```

If you are sending emails this way, nothing should change. The mails will be sent the way before via the MessengerBus.
You could also inject the MailerInterface from Symfony Mailer and you will get the MessengerMailer injected.

If you truly want to send emails asynchronously you have to configure the routing section in your Messenger.php
```php
return [
    'routing' => [
        \Symfony\Component\Mailer\Messenger\SendEmailMessage::class => ['senders' => ['async']],
    ]
]
```

Nothing comes for free. There are some caveats to tackle if you are sending emails asynchronously.
Also have a look at the Symfony Documentation [Sending Messages Async](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#sending-messages-async).

**Note**:
Be aware that you should inject either the \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Mail\MailerInterface or the \Symfony\Component\Mailer\MailerInterface in your classes and explicitly pass your MailMessage to the send method.
Do not call the send method on the MailMessage object itself because this will bypass the shipped decorator and you cannot send your email messages asynchronously

## ConfigurationProvider

If you have installed **typo3/cms-lowlevel** you can see your Messenger configuration within the Configuration module under the section **Messenger Configuration**

You cannot only see your System wide configuration but also your Messages and the assigned Handlers.

## Environment specific configurations

If you want to handle i.e. your messages synchronously in the development environment but still asynchronously in the production environment you can do so.
You just have to place another Messenger.php under Configuration/dev/ in your extension.
You can do the same for your testing environment by placing the Messenger.php under Configuration/test/ folder.
It is a simple convention but convenient in your daily developer life.
Have a look at [Handling Messages Sync while Developing](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/messenger/dev-sync) why this feature is so convenient.
